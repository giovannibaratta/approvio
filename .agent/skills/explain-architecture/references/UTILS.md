# Utils Layer

Shared utilities and helper functions used across the entire application.

## Responsibility

- Shared validation helpers.
- Type guards and advanced TypeScript utilities.
- Common date/string/uuid formatting.

## Directory

`app/utils/src/`

## Architectural Constraints

- **Purity**: Utility functions should ideally be pure (no side effects).
- **Generic**: Designed to be reusable across different domains.
- **Type Safety**: Leverage the TypeScript type system to provide robust utilities.
