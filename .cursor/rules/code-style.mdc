When writing code:
- If a switch statement is used, try to use switch exhaustiveness check instead of adding default case
- If a file contains both interfaces and classes with implementations logic, place the interfaces at the end of the file.

When writing tests:
- use the Given:[context], When, Expect pattern
- group tests in bad cases, good cases
