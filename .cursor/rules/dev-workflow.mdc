Workflow for Code Modifications:
1. Schema Update (if needed):
* Modify Liquibase migration files.
* Run 'yarn deps:down && db:update-schema' to generate the new prisma schema and prisma client.
1. Implement Domain Logic.
1. Define Domain Unit Tests.
1. Define Service and Dependency Interfaces (e.g. repository, third-part provider, ...).
1. Implement External Dependencies (e.g., repository).
1. Implement Service Logic.
1. Implement Controller Logic.
1. Write Controller Integration Tests.

Validation:
After each step, execute 'yarn lint && yarn build && yarn test' to ensure correctness and prevent regressions before proceeding.

Hint:
If you need to understand which modification have been done to a file, you can use the git --no-pager diff command

<constraints>
- Never to a git commit, git stash or a git push. You are not allowed to perform these actions. You can only act in read only mode on git.
