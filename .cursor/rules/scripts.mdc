## Usage Notes

- Scripts like `start` and `start:dev` are long-running processes that will occupy the terminal session. They are intended for active development and application serving.
- The `deps:*` scripts are used to manage external services required by the application, likely orchestrated with Docker via the `. They are non-blocking.
- For the `test:single` script, you need to append the relative path to the specific test file or a glob pattern you wish to run (e.g., `yarn test:single app/services/src/user/user.service.test.ts`).
- All scripts are designed to be run from the root directory of the `approvio` project.
