<context>
The project you are working on is a backend service to manage the Approval process at scale. The project is written in Typescript.

<prisma schema>
In order to update the prima schema after the liquibase migration files has been modified:
1. start the database with yarn deps:start
2. update the database with yarn liquibase:update:dev
3. Pull the schema with yarn prisma:pull (this will update schema.prisma)
4. Regenerate the Prisma client with yarn prisma:generate
</prisma>

// Folders to prioritize for general context.
// The agent will look here first when trying to understand the project.
priority {
  app/main/src // Main application logic, entry points
  app/services/src // Core business logic
  app/domain/src // Domain entities and value objects
  app/controllers/src // API request/response handling
}

// Rules for specific file types or concerns.
// "glob" uses standard glob patterns (e.g., *, **, ?, []).
// "category" helps the agent understand the file's purpose.
// "associated": Describes files or folders often related to this category.
// "ignore": Tells the agent to generally avoid these files for this category unless directly asked.
