# Approvio Backend

A scalable approval management system built with NestJS and TypeScript that enables organizations to define, execute, and manage complex approval workflows at scale (or at least this is the goal ðŸ˜„).

## Overview

Approvio is a backend service designed to streamline and automate approval processes within organizations. It provides a framework for creating approval workflow templates, managing approval rules, handling user permissions, and executing approval workflows with comprehensive audit trails.

> Approvio is not responsible for running your workflow. It is tool that you can integrate in your automated and non-automated workflows to obtain the required approval before running them.

### Example use cases

#### Financial approval

A company needs to implement an approval process for budget allocation requests. The business rule requires approval from three different stakeholders before any budget can be allocated:

- 1 Manager (from the requesting department)
- 1 VP (Vice President level approval)
- 1 Finance team member (for budget validation)

**Implementation with Approvio:**

1. **Create Groups**: Set up "Managers", "VPs", and "Finance" groups with appropriate members
2. **Define Template**: Create a workflow template with an AND approval rule:
   ```
   AND {
     GROUP_REQUIREMENT(Managers, minCount: 1),
     GROUP_REQUIREMENT(VPs, minCount: 1),
     GROUP_REQUIREMENT(Finance, minCount: 1)
   }
   ```
3. **Request Approval**: When a budget request is submitted, create a workflow instance
4. **Collect Votes**: Each group member can vote APPROVE or VETO through the API
5. **Automatic Resolution**: The workflow automatically becomes APPROVED when all three groups have provided at least one approval each

#### Multi-agent workflows (not yet implementable)

An autonomous agent needs to perform a potentially dangerous system operation (like deploying code to production or modifying critical infrastructure). To ensure safety, two additional AI agents must evaluate and approve the request before execution.

**Future Implementation with Approvio:**

1. **Agent Groups**: Create groups for "SecurityAI" and "InfrastructureAI" with the respective agent identities
2. **Safety Template**: Define a workflow template requiring approval from both agent groups:
   ```
   AND {
     GROUP_REQUIREMENT(SecurityAI, minCount: 1),
     GROUP_REQUIREMENT(InfrastructureAI, minCount: 1)
   }
   ```
3. **Automated Request**: The requesting agent creates a workflow with operation details
4. **AI Evaluation**: Each approver agent analyzes the request using their specialized models
5. **Programmatic Voting**: Agents vote via API calls based on their safety assessments
6. **Execution Gate**: The operation only proceeds if both agents approve, providing an automated safety checkpoint

> A human could be included in the loop based on the requirements.
