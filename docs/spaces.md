# Spaces

Spaces are logical containers that organize workflow templates within your organization. They provide a way to group related approval processes by project, team, department, or any other organizational boundary that makes sense for your business.

## Core Concepts

### What Are Spaces?

Spaces act as organizational units that help you:

- **Organize workflow templates** by project, team, or domain
- **Control access** through space-specific permissions
- **Separate concerns** between different parts of your organization
- **Maintain clarity** as your approval processes scale

**Examples:**

- A "Finance" space containing expense approvals, budget requests, and purchase orders
- An "HR" space with leave requests, hiring approvals, and policy acknowledgments
- A "DevOps" space managing deployment approvals and infrastructure changes
